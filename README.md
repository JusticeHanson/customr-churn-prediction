# Classification Module for Telco-Churn Prediction

### **Introduction**

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers or subscribers by a business. Understanding the factors that contribute to churn and predicting which customers are at risk is crucial for businesses. In this project, we leverage various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for customer churn.

**Predicting customer churn offers several benefits**

 - Retention: Identifying at-risk customers allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized incentives or improving customer service.

 - Cost Reduction: Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Predicting churn helps businesses focus resources on high-value customers, thereby reducing marketing costs.

 - Business Insights: Analyzing churn factors provides valuable insights into customer behavior, helping businesses enhance their products and services.

### **Dataset**

The dataset for this project includes customer information such as demographics, usage patterns, and service details, along with a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned. We split the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

### **Data Preprocessing**

Before building the models, we preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for training. The preprocessing steps include:

- Handling Missing Values: Using techniques like imputation to fill in missing values or removing rows with missing data.

 - Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

 - Scaling Numerical Features: Scaling numerical features to a similar range to avoid biasing the models.


### **Model Building and Evaluation**

We train and evaluate several machine learning models on the preprocessed data. The models used in this project include:

 - Decision Tree Classifier

 - Random Forest Classifier

 - Logistic Regression Classifier

 - Support Vector Machine

For each model, we compute evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and F2 score. We also generate a confusion matrix and a classification report for each model.


### **Model Comparison**

After evaluating the models, we compare their performance based on the evaluation metrics. The Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the best accuracy, precision, and F2 score, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. Other models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier, also showed good performance in terms of F1 score and accuracy.


### **Model Fine-Tuning**

To further enhance the performance of the selected models, we fine-tune their hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization. The hyperparameters are tuned for Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier models. The fine-tuned models are then evaluated on the test data, and the evaluation metrics are recorded.


### **Conclusion**

In this project, we demonstrated the use of machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction. By training and evaluating different models, we identified the best-performing model and fine-tuned its hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy in predicting customer churn. This information can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
